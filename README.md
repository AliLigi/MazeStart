# MazeStart

##Running
In the Jar folder and type the command "java -cp AiMazeGame.jar ie.gmit.sw.Runner"

##Features 
This is based on a few programs we have put together in class. It has a Fuzzy logic system for the health, for the weapon and will display the victory depending on the rules i have added.
Then the enemies have two forms. Astar and DFS they are hunting the player. I didnt fully get this working. I mistaked the deadline and therefore didnt have time to displat these on the maze.
There are a few maze generators in the game. First : The binary-tree-algorithm -> http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2011/2/1/maze-generation-binary-tree-algorithm ,
the simplest of the maze generation algorithms to implement,
It can build the entire maze by looking at only a single cell at a time,fastest to run,It is novel in that it can operate without any state at all,
needs to look at the current cell, it can be used to generate mazes of infinite size.
Second: maze-generation-recursive-backtracking -> http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/27/maze-generation-recursive-backtracking,
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maze_generation_algorithm, 
Recursive backtracker algorithm, Unlike Eller's algorithm, This algorithm is a randomized version of the depth-first search algorithm, 
A maze can be generated by starting with a predetermined arrangement of cells (most commonly a rectangular grid but other arrangements are possible) with wall sites between them.
I didn't get this algorithm working properly yet if i have  got time i will return at the end
Third: eller-s-algorithm->http://weblog.jamisbuck.org/2010/12/29/maze-generation-eller-s-algorithm, http://www.neocomputer.org/projects/eller.html
Eller's algorithm for maze generation, requires memory proportional to the size of a single row, you can generate "bottomless" mazes with it, 
Eller's algorithm creates 'perfect' mazes, having only a single path between any two cells, one row at a time

###Issues
-The game does not display the enemies and the weapons due to the lack of time to fix these little problems, the weapon class was not finished,some of the code not working properly.
